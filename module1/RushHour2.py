# *** REPRESENTATION ***
# STATE DESCRIPTION
# Each state is a list of vehicles of the same format as input format.

# STATE TRANSITIONS (MOVES)
# Transitions (moves) are represented as a string consisting of two characters:
# - a number equal to the index of the car that is about to be moved
# - a letter indicating the direction of the move (N,S,W,E)

# EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
# - Matplotlib for visualizing the data
